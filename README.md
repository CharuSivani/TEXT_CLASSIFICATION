# Text Classification Project

A machine learning-based text classification model designed to categorize text data into predefined classes. This project involves preprocessing text, training models, and evaluating their performance on various datasets.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Text tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean the text.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Implements various algorithms including Naive Bayes, SVM, and others.
- **Evaluation**: 
  - Uses performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Includes visualizations for data distribution and model performance.

## Running the Project

1. Open the `Text_Classifier.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
3. Experiment with different models and datasets to improve performance.

### Example Workflow

```python
# Sample training process using Naive Bayes
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Convert text data to TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train the classifier
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test_vec)
